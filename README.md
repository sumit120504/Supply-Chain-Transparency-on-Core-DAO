# Supply Chain Transparency on Core DAO

## 📌 Project Description
This project leverages Core DAO's EVM-compatible blockchain to provide a decentralized supply chain tracking system. Each product’s journey—from manufacturing to final sale—is recorded on-chain, ensuring transparency, tamper-proof history, and accountability among supply chain actors.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To build a trusted and verifiable ecosystem where every stakeholder in the supply chain can:
- Prove the authenticity of their product’s origin.
- Access real-time product movement and ownership history.
- Detect fraud or counterfeiting through immutable records.

By decentralizing the supply chain records, we eliminate information asymmetry, improve traceability, and empower consumers with product provenance.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- 🔗 Integration with IPFS/Arweave to store additional metadata (invoices, certificates).
- 🧠 AI-based risk detection for bottlenecks or delays.
- 📦 QR code generation and scanning support for product tracking.
- 🧾 Integration with IoT sensors for automated stage updates.
- 🌐 Multi-chain interoperability and real-time analytics dashboards.

## 🚀 Key Features
- ✅ Add products with manufacturer identity.
- 🔄 Update product ownership and stage securely.
- 🧾 Immutable, timestamped product trail stored on Core DAO.
- 🔍 Public product verification and auditability.
- 👨‍💼 Owner-restricted update operations for secure tracking.
